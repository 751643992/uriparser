== SOON ==
 * Return error code instead of error position
   * Move parser struct back outside
 * Option to turn off segment extraction if
   validating only?
 * Add escape function
 * Add specific URI support (callbacks?)

== LATER ==
 * Add code documentation
   * until no more Doxygen warnings
   * Is there a way to mark the public API part?
 * Add documentation on semantic actions?
